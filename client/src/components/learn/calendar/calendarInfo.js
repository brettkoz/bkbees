      <p>
        The bees remain clustered throughout the month of January. As in
        December, the only real thing we can do for our bees is keep their
        entrance clear of snow and dead bees. Keep an eye on your covers during
        the winter as winter storms can blow off even heavily weighted
        telescoping covers. Purchase bees for next year and plan all of your
        equipment purchases. Watch old beekeeping YouTube videos to keep your
        senses sharp and prevent a “re-learning” period next Spring.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the winter solstice, the days being to lengthen and the bees use
        this cue to start maintaining a brood nest again. This is great, as it
        allows for a regeneration of the winter population and begins
        preparations for our spring bees, but offers some perils in the fact
        that the cluster now has to maintain a considerably higher temperature
        of 93f, making the bees more susceptible to temperature fluctuations and
        causing them to go through more honey stores.

      <p>
        February matches January in almost every respect. As the days lengthen
        the brood nest will grow, modestly until the temperatures allow a large
        expansion. On a warmer sunny day you can lift up the back of your hives
        (without weights or excess snow) to get a good feeling of their
        remaining stores. If your hives are light you can consider adding dry
        sugar in either the sugar brick or mountain camp methods.

  march: (
    <div>
      <h1 className="display-5">March</h1>
      <p>
        The bees will start to find pollen in the month of March, urging them to
        start the process of returning to normal hive activities. The queen will
        start laying to almost full capacity as the month goes on and warmer
        weather allows. Make sure your hives have food, just because they are
        able to start finding some pollen does not mean there are any nectar
        sources quite yet, so they need sugar and they probably need it bad.
        March is a month where many beekeepers are tricked into thinking their
        hives have survived the winter, just to see them die out due to
        starvation. You can start feeding them sugar syrup, candy boards or
        extra honey frames (if you have any).
      </p>
      <p>
        You may want to start thinking of feeding pollen, as the influx of
        pollen can embolden the queen to lay more eggs, boosting your hive’s
        early spring buildup.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Get out there and open your hives, clean the dead-outs and feed the
        survivors.

  april: (
    <div>
      <h1 className="display-5">April</h1>
      <p>
        The bees have returned to full activity, finding nectar and pollen in
        early spring blooms of maple trees, locust trees, honeysuckle,
        dandelions and quite a few other trees and bushes. Get into your hives
        and inspect the brood pattern, consider replacing the queen if she has
        not returned to laying a solid pattern. Consider inverting your brood
        boxes, putting the empty lower box above the occupied one, this gives
        the queen a host of other cells to move UP (she always moves up when
        searching for more space to lay) to, allowing your colony to increase in
        population greatly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do a mite count for your overwintered hives in April to get a good idea
        where the mite load is at. Take efforts to control a mite load over 2%
        at this time of year (2 mites per 100 bees). Walk away splits and formic
        acid are both great tools at this time of year because it’s the time to
        start making splits and the temperatures are well within the Mite Away
        Quick Strips range.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the later part of April, the nectar really starts to flow. Pull the
        feeders from the stronger hives and add honey supers. Keep feeding
        weaker hives if they need a boost, but keep the supers off of the hives
        that are consuming sugar syrup, this keeps that sugar out of your honey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watch out for swarm preparations in April, stronger hives may be getting
        to that point and the best course of action at this time would be a
        swarm prevention split.
      </p>
      <p>
        April is the month most bee packages are delivered. Make sure you feed
        as much as the package needs while it is getting built up.

  may: (
    <div>
      <h1 className="display-5">May</h1>
      <p>
        The full nectar flow is underway and you can remove feeders from any
        hives that still have them. Stay on top of their population, making sure
        they have enough room to expand, thereby warding off any swarming. Keep
        an empty super on all hives that have more than one brood box, they want
        to pack honey away above the brood nest and all you need to do is make
        sure they have somewhere to store it, lest they start to backfill the
        brood area and create a difficult situation for you.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider setting out a swarm trap in your bee yard or in other areas
        that you can check regularly. May is the beginning of the true swarm
        season and swarms caught at this time of year are very likely of the
        reproductive variety (as opposed to cramped swarms or absconds) and
        therefore the highest quality swarm you can catch. Old brood comb and
        lemongrass oil are both great cheap swarm lures.
      </p>
      <p>
        May is a great month to make splits from your overwintered colonies. The
        nearby drones are reaching sexual maturity and will be flooding the
        drone congregation areas very soon. Make sure you give your splits food,
        as the breakup of overall workforce will mean a lesser ability for each
        component to forage. Mark the date you set out your walk away splits and
        plan on checking for eggs in one month.{" "}

  june: (
    <div>
      <h1 className="display-5">June</h1>
      <p>
        Much the same as May, the bees are interested in packing honey away.
        Keep adding supers when necessary. Check the queens laying pattern and
        replace her if necessary. Keep an eye out for swarming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sumac, milkweed, linden (basswood) and clover all contribute to a hearty
        nectar flow here in Michigan in the month of June.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do a mite count and plan on taking action if the mite load is over a 2%
        concentration. Good options in June are formic acid (follow the
        instructions and pay attention to ambient temperature!), oxalic acid
        (remove your honey supers!) and thymol. You can still perform walk away
        splits at this time of year, too, so consider that as an aspect of your
        Integrated Pest Management Plan.

  july: (
    <div>
      <h1 className="display-5">July</h1>
      <p>
        Throughout the majority of the month of July, in Michigan, the nectar
        flow continues, with blooming milkweed, butterfly weed, thistle, bee
        balm and more, so continue to add honey supers as needed. Toward the end
        of the month, the nectar slows down and the bees use that along with the
        shortening of the days after the summer solstice (at the end of June) to
        start winter preparations. The brood nest will start to shrink and the
        nectar/honey will encroach into the brood area. This starts in small,
        imperceptible ways at this time of year, but it is good to understand
        that point so that you can start envisioning winter configurations. Get
        all of your hives moved to their winter locations and start purchasing
        or building the winter components (quilt box, moisture boards, upper
        entrance shims, candy board shims) so that you’re not playing catch-up
        later on.

  august: (
    <div>
      <h1 className="display-5">August</h1>
      <p>
        August is possibly the most important month of the beekeeping year.
        During this month the bees will start to rear “winter bees”, specialized
        workers with enlarged fat bodies that will allow them to dispense and
        consume nutrients throughout the winter and stay alive for up to 6
        months (as opposed to 6 weeks for a “summer bee”). The healthy
        development of these bees from the day the egg is laid until the day
        they take their first flight, is crucial to the overwintering success
        chances. Parasitization by mites during the larval period of these bees
        greatly reduces these specialized traits and will make surviving the
        winter MUCH harder. My target date here in Michigan for having the mites
        in check is August 15th. If you haven’t done anything or paid any
        attention to the mite load all year, do yourself and your bees a favor
        and do a mite count. Treat anything at or above a 3% threshold (3 mites
        per 100 bees). Treatment options this time of year are formic acid (if
        the temperatures allow, follow the instructions CAREFULLY), thymol or
        oxalic acid (only affects phoretic mites, may require more than one
        treatment).
      </p>
      <p>
        The nectar flow has essentially ended, although Goldenrod is on its way
        and that, depending on your location, may be a major nectar influx.
        Consider removing excess honey supers mid month and keeping them off for
        the rest of the year. This will allow the fall nectar/honey to
        contribute to their winter weight.

  september: (
    <div>
      <h1 className="display-5">September</h1>
      <p>
        September is our last chance as beekeepers to have a great effect on how
        our bees will go into winter. Conduct your final inspections early in
        September, noting the size of the colony, the amount of food stores (and
        overall weight) and their overall density. If they aren’t completely
        filling the space they have, consider reducing the amount of boxes. What
        would seem like a swarm ready colony in June (in terms of density) is a
        perfect situation in September/October. This last inspection should be
        the last time you separate boxes or crack any seals. From here on, the
        bees will take over.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure all hives have an upper entrance (upper entrances are
        essential in winter for both ventilation and an entrance/exit that won’t
        get clogged with falling, dead bees). If you are adding an upper
        entrance as a shim, add it as soon as you can, so the bees have an
        opportunity to seal the cracks with propolis.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Goldenrod will bloom throughout much of September. In many parts of the
        country that can be a considerable nectar flow and can offer a great
        boon to your bees’ winter pantry. After the goldenrod is done blooming,
        however, that’s it. There won’t be any more nectar and with nothing else
        to do, the bees start robbing. Make sure to add robbing screens or
        reduce entrance sizes before the goldenrod is done. Robbing can be swift
        and devastating, so be proactive rather than reactive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start feeding your light hives in September. A good mark to shoot for is
        100lbs of carbohydrates per hive, per winter.
      </p>
      <p>Consider combining weaker colonies in late September.</p>

  october: (

      <p>
        The bees are switching to Winter mode now. The nights are getting longer
        and the brood nest has shrunk considerably. The nectar flow is done and
        during warm days the robbing threat is high. Make sure all of your hives
        are winter ready in terms of location, upper entrance, overall weight
        and density. You can install your moisture control system or add your
        extra insulation toward the end of the month. Continue feeding until
        either the goal weight is met or the nights are drifting into the low
        40s. Pull all liquid food before the nights start to freeze.

  november: (
    <div>
      <h1 className="display-5">November</h1>
      <p>
        The bees are clustered for the winter, only flying when the temperature
        reaches 50 degrees or so. They remain clustered inside the hive to
        maintain proper temperatures. As the temperature fluctuates, the
        size/density of the cluster fluctuates to maintain a nice warm 85f
        internal temperature. This does not mean the entire hive cavity is kept
        at 85f, only the cluster. Cold region adapted honey bees are incredible
        in their ability to maintain a proper cluster temperature while going
        through a minimum of stores (sometimes as low as 3lbs of honey per
        month). Ideal situations for us as beekeepers during the winter are
        sunny, windless situations maintaining temperatures at or just above
        freezing. Those circumstances allow the least effort by the bees to
        maintain temperature while being cold enough to prevent unnecessary
        flight or hive activities that may use excess resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can consider oxalic acid fogging for mite control in November as the
        majority of hives will be broodless, making oxalic acid much more
        effective than during warmer months where a large portion of the mites
        are underneath brood cappings. Don’t confuse this mite control effort as
        an effort to get your bees to survive the winter. Any damage that has
        been done is already complete, as the “winter bees” have already
        progressed through their larval period. This mite control effort will
        have a beneficial impact on next spring’s bees, giving them a mite free
        start to the year.

        The bees are enjoying the holidays in a cluster, eating nearby honey
        when the need arises but mostly they staying tightly clustered and most
        likely completely broodless. There isn’t much we as beekeepers can do
        during the month of December. You can scoop dead bees out of the
        entrance of your hives to increase ventilation and prevent a wet, moldy
        mess. Other than that, consider planning equipment and bee purchases for
        next year.
